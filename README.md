# NetworkVisualiser
A tool to visualise network traffic, built using jNetPcap.

## About
This tool is being built as part of an online learning course. The idea is simple - can I put my new knowledge of networking to the test and create a tool similar to Wireshark?
## Current Progress
Right now, the tool can do the following:
- Capture packets on any NIC
- Aggregate the total data sent, and data sent per second
- Display this data in a graph
- Analyse TCP/UDP connection information [W.I.P]
## Future Objectives
Before the course ends, I aim to have the following:
- A full GUI to analyse the capture at each level of the OSI model
- A way to navigate through the packets captured
- Increased control over the graphs generated
## Usage
This tool is not ready for proper use. If you wish to use it, however, you will need to install jNetPcap/JavaFX and compile the source code yourself.
